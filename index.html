        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a second year at college majoring in psychology. I am looking to obtain a future with a career in the psychology field. There are many goals and opportunities with this subject. Psychologists must take many precautions and measures throughout their career. I learned many importanceâ€™s that go into the career role of becoming a psychologist. There is many notetakings, as well as mental-taking when looking after children and young adults. Psychologists are needed to describe what they see, explain how it connects to the human development and behavior, predict their findings, and find a way to change their predictions and help their clients. 
 <br><br>

        Describing a behavior or cognition is the first goal of psychology. This can enable researchers to develop general laws of human behavior. Once researchers have described general laws behavior, the next step is to explain how or why this trend occurs. Psychologists will propose theories which can explain a behavior. Psychology aims to be able to predict future behavior from the findings of empirical research. If a prediction is not confirmed, then the explanation it is based on might need to be revised. For example, classical conditioning predicts that if a person associates a negative outcome with a stimuli, they may develop a phobia or aversion of the stimuli. Lastly, once psychology has described, explained, and made predictions about behavior, changing, or controlling a behavior can be attempted. For example, interventions based on classical conditioning, such as systematic desensitization, have been used to treat people with anxiety disorders including phobias.<br><br>

        Behaviorism, as known as behavioral psychology, is what helps psychologists examine and analyze childrenâ€™s behavior, is also a theory of learning which states all behaviors are learned through interaction with the environment through a process called conditioning. Thus, behavior is simply a response to environmental stimuli. Behaviorism is only concerned with observable stimulus-response behaviors, as they can be studied in a systematic and observable manner. Many approaches go into this career, such as the psychodynamic approach. The psychodynamic approach includes all the theories in psychology that see human functioning based upon the interaction of drives and forces within the person, particularly unconscious, and between the different structures of the personality. There are many approaches that lead to examining a childâ€™s behavior, such as the psychodynamic approach. The psychodynamic approach includes all the theories in psychology that see human functioning based upon the interaction of drives and forces within the person, particularly unconscious, and between the different structures of the personality. In my college classes so far, I have learned many of the important aspects and points taken into the types of behavior needed to look out for this certain career path. Going into my college career I knew I wanted to major in the humanities field; however, it has help me realize what exact career path I want to take. It has definitely helped me expand my mind in the doâ€™s and donâ€™ts, as well as how to experience and practice this learnings throughout my everyday actions.
